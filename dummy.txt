Deep learning is an artificial intelligence function that imitates the workings of the
human brain in processing data and creating patterns for use in decision making.
 Deep learning is a subset of machine learning in artificial intelligence (AI) that has
 networks capable of learning unsupervised from data that is unstructured or unlabeled.
 Also known as deep neural learning or deep neural network.
